 <h3>This is my OOP Practical work during the second year of preparatory classes at <a href="https://www.esi.dz/"> ESI - École Nationale Supérieure d'Informatique - Alger (ex INI).</a> </h3>

+   Realizing a very simple compiler that can compile and run a program written in a pseudo 
+   programming language designed for the needs of the lab
+   Our compiler will parse and execute the program line by line and that is why we call it interpreter.
