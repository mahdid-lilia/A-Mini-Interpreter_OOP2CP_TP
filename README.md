# A Mini Interpreter OOP2CP TP

```diff
- This is my OOP Practical work during the second year of preparatory classes at ESI Algiers 
+   Realizing a very simple compiler that can compile and run a program written in a pseudo 
+   programming language designed for the needs of the lab.
+   Our compiler will parse and execute the program line by line and that is why we call it interpreter.
